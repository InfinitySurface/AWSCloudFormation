# CloudFormation using AWS

CloudFormation is an AWS service that uses files (.json/.yaml) to deploys resources across the AWS infrastructure. CloudFromation is essential for many developers that helps productivity, time, and even cost when developing big cloud projects for a company. Below will have many explanations on how to use CloudFromation including an in-depth look of how our dummy application will be structured.
