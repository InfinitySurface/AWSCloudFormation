# CloudFormation using AWS

CloudFormation is an AWS service that uses files (.json/.yaml) to deploys resources across the AWS infrastructure. CloudFromation is essential for many developers that it helps productivity, time, and even cost when developing big projects for a company. Down below will have many explanations on how to use CloudFromation including an in-depth look of how our dummy application will look once you deploy the 3 .yaml files.
